A team of University of Ottawa researchers wants to understand how public servants in Canada experience and cope with meaninglessness while at work. The goal is to better understand this under-researched and under-acknowledged phenomenon. There is a serious need for such knowledge given the amount of time people spend on their jobs.

This study is currently full and we are no longer recruiting participants. For more information, please contact the principal investigator Christopher Belanger via email:
