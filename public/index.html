                    <p>A team of University of Ottawa researchers wants to understand how public servants in Canada experience and cope with meaninglessness while at work. The goal is to better understand this under-researched and under-acknowledged phenomenon. There is a serious need for such knowledge given the amount of time people spend on their jobs.</p>
